# 5.5 Monochrome Versions

We understand that it is not always possible to use the logo in the standard version typically on a white, clean background. For this reason, we have prepared the following versions of the logo in monochrome.   
**The white version**. It is designed for use on a colored background or image, where the default logo would lose its legibility.   
**The black version**. To be used only on materials where color printing is unavailable.   
**The gray version**. We recommend using this variant in materials co-created with our partners where our colors conflict with the branding colors of the partner company.
