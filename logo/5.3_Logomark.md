# 5.3 Logomark

The logomark complements the logotype and could be used as an independent brand mark. We took this factor into account at the conceptual stage and made sure the logomark is recognizable and simple, and so could be easily associated with the brand.   
To maintain the geometry and harmony of the shape and proportions, we applied the golden ratio.   
This is visible both in the circles that form the curvature of the “display” and in the arrangement of the basic elements of the logomark.   
While looking for the perfect shape, we have not forgotten about the modern profile and agile nature of our company – this is emphasized by the warm color and characteristic “display” representing one of the highlights of our product.
