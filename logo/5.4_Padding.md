![][image14]  
In order to ensure optimal readability of the logo, we have defined padding around the logomark; this space should remain free from any graphic elements. The padding size is defined by the circle around the logomark.   
In order to ensure the clarity of the logo we have also determined the minimum logo sizes – shown on the right – which should be respected in printed and digital materials.
