# 8.1 Illustrations

Illustrations are an addition and not key elements of publications. They should only complement texts and not draw attention away from it. Graphics must, therefore, be simple, legible and minimalist to effectively convey required meaning.   
Such an effect can be achieved only by using a few graphic elements to avoid distraction. To maintain a proper contrast among these elements, such illustrations should have a white, clean background.   
Although the shades of orange and navy blue are the leading colors, it is often desirable to make illustrations more diverse by using secondary colors \- blue and green.
