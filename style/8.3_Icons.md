# 8.3 Icons

Icons, although small, are supposed to enhance any text. They cannot be random, so use them carefully to convey the key message.   
Icons that effectively serve their purpose are simple and legible. Anyone looking at them should immediately understand the meaning behind them. For that reason, we have decided on the use of our own library – one- color outline icons suitable for various situations.
