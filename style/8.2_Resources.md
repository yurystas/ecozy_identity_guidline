# 8.2 Resources

Because we care about our business partners and would like to facilitate the process of creating engaging graphics for them, we have prepared a large collection of ready-to-use resources. Moreover, new objects, characters and products are being added to our libraries on a regular basis. Appropriate use of these graphic elements allows maintaining a uniform brand image.   
Graphics should not be crowded with too many elements. When choosing resources for illustrations, it is important to remember one simple rule: less is more.
