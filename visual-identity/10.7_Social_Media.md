# 10.7 Social Media

To maintain a consistent brand image on various social networking sites, we have prepared a template showing the fixed place for the logo and product version.   
If a published post concerns a set of products or a product without mentioning a specific product version, no additional information is necessary.   
If the standard version of the logo is not visible, use alternative monochromatic versions.
