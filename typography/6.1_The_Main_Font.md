# 6.1 The Main Font

The main font, which perfectly fits the character of the brand, is Poppins.   
In terms of style, Poppins fills the gap between modernist regular shape fonts and classic sans-serif-free fonts. The result is a hybrid combining humanistic proportions with a relatively geometric overall look.   
Although the Poppins family contains more than 140 separate fonts, we recommend using the basic set shown opposite together with the equivalent set in italics.
