# 6.3 Text Layout Guidelines

The font is only a tool – to enhance the perception of the brand you need to use it wisely. To maintain the transparency of the collateral materials and to make sure your taglines and key sentiments get through to the target audience, we recommend using our template shown on the right.   
First of all, the text must be legible – for this reason, there must be high contrast between the font color and its background. The ideal situation is black text on a white background.   
On colored background (for example on buttons) place pure white text.
