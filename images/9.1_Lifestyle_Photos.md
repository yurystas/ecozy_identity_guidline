# 9.1 Lifestyle Photos

Content is the most important part of any publication, however, we cannot underestimate the importance of images. Information contained in images helps with easier assimilation of the main content and creation of positive associations. In order to emphasize the quality of offered services and products, we recommend considering the following factors when selecting images:   
**Clarity**. Organized and mainly white foreground. Uncluttered background to facilitate legibility.   
**Diversity**. Tailor images to the target audience. Represent individuals of different genders, age, culture and race.   
**Topic**. Depicted situations should relate to the domains we focus on.   
**Accents**. Primary brand colors in photos reinforce brand identification and define the company’s character.
