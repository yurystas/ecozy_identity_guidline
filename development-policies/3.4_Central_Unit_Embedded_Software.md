# 3.4 Central Unit Embedded Software

1. ### Introduction {#introduction-2}

The central unit is a gateway device in the system.The main functions is: 

* Collecting data from thermostats and temperature sensors, including current temperature, humidity, and configured settings.  
* Making decisions based on climate control algorithms.  
* Connecting to thermostats and temperature sensors via the Matter-over-Thread protocol, ensuring stable and energy-efficient communication.  
* Sending collected data (e.g., temperature readings, configurations) to a cloud service for storage, analysis, and long-term monitoring.  
* Receiving updates and new configurations from the cloud.

The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is used as the System on Module (SoM).
