# 4.6 Ecosystem & Connectivity

* **Full Smart Home Integration (Protocol Level)** We are committed to a "no-walled-garden" approach. Our devices function seamlessly with Google Home, Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and other major platforms via the **Matter-over-Thread** standard, ensuring robust local control and future-proof compatibility.  
* **Full Smart Home Integration (Backend Level)** Beyond local protocols, our platform's cloud architecture offers deep API integration with major smart home ecosystems. This ensures unified control and status synchronization across all user interfaces, regardless of the underlying hardware ecosystem.  
* **"Local" Offline Mode** To ensure reliability and privacy, we are developing a fully autonomous operation mode. In this state, the eCozy Central Unit functions as a local backend server, storing all user data and executing control logic within the closed local network, completely independent of internet connectivity.  
* **IFTTT & Third-Party Integration** We enable advanced cross-platform automation by connecting eCozy to thousands of external apps and services via IFTTT. This allows users to build complex workflows that extend beyond standard smart home routines.  
* **Over-the-Air (OTA) Firmware Updates** Our infrastructure supports secure, automatic delivery of the latest features, security patches, and performance optimizations, ensuring the hardware evolves and improves long after the initial purchase.
