# 4.2 Energy Harvesting

**Text:** To further our commitment to sustainability and user convenience, we are actively researching energy harvesting technologies. The primary focus is on integrating **Peltier (thermoelectric) generators** into the thermostat. This would allow the device to harvest energy from the temperature difference (delta-T) between the hot radiator and the ambient room air, potentially eliminating the need for batteries entirely and creating a truly autonomous device.
