# 4.5 Pipeline (Radiator Fans, iPad App, Web App)

**Text:**

* **Radiator Fans:** Developing a "radiator fan boost" accessory that attaches to existing radiators to improve heat convection, allowing rooms to heat up faster and at lower water temperatures, further increasing system efficiency.  
* **Web App / iPad App:** Launching a dedicated, large-screen experience for "power users." This will provide advanced analytics, multi-property management (e.g., for landlords or vacation homes), and a more detailed interface for configuring complex heating scenarios.
