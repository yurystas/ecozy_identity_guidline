# 4.4 Smart Home Products (Window Sensor, Leak Sensor, Light Shutter, Blinds Control)

**Text:** The eCozy Central Unit is designed as a scalable hub. Our roadmap includes expanding the eCozy ecosystem with a suite of Matter-enabled accessories that directly contribute to heating efficiency:

* **Window/Door Sensor:** Automatically pauses heating in a room when a window is opened to prevent energy waste.  
* **Smart Blinds/Shutter Control:** Works in tandem with the thermostat to close blinds during hot summer days (to reduce solar gain) or open them during cold sunny days (to maximize it).  
* **Leak Sensor:** Provides peace of mind by alerting users to water leaks near radiators or pipes.
