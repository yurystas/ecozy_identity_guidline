# 4.7 Acoustic Intelligence & Safety

* **Edge-AI Acoustic Pattern Recognition** Using our proprietary Edge-AI algorithms, the thermostat acts as an intelligent "bridge" for legacy devices. Users can train the device to recognize unique home sounds—such as a specific doorbell or appliance chime—triggering smart home routines. Crucially, the system comes pre-trained to detect critical alerts like standard smoke and CO alarms.  
* **Acoustic Radiator Diagnostics** We are leveraging our onboard microphone to perform predictive maintenance. The system actively listens for the specific auditory signatures of trapped air (gurgling or hissing) within the radiator and alerts the user when bleeding is required to maintain heating efficiency.  
* **Acoustic Leak Detection** Expanding our acoustic engine, this feature detects the faint, persistent frequencies associated with water drips or pipe leaks near the radiator. This provides an early warning system for potential water damage, protecting the user's property.  
* **Advanced Sleep Support** By combining acoustic analysis with environmental sensors, the system can detect signs of restlessness or snoring. It then subtly adjusts the bedroom temperature profile throughout the night to optimize thermal comfort and improve sleep quality.
