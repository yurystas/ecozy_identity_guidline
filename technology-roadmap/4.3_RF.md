**Text:** While our current ecosystem is standardized on Matter-over-Thread and Bluetooth, we are actively investigating **Ultra-Wideband (UWB)**. The goal is to enable highly accurate, room-level presence detection. This would allow the heating system to make decisions based on *which room* a user is in, not just whether the home is occupied, enabling hyper-efficient "follow-me" heating.
