# 4.8 Core Experience Evolution

* **Intelligent Scheduling & Modes** We provide users with granular control through detailed heating schedules customizable by day or week. This is complemented by **Preset Modes**, offering one-tap adjustments for common scenarios (e.g., "Go Away" / "Go Home") to instantly adapt the home environment.  
* **Geofencing Automation** To maximize energy efficiency without compromising comfort, the system utilizes the user's phone location to automatically adjust heating—lowering temperatures when the house is empty and pre-heating as the user returns.  
* **Energy-Saving Ventilation Detection** The system automatically detects sudden temperature drops indicative of an open window and pauses heating in that specific zone. This prevents energy waste during ventilation cycles.  
* **User-Defined Custom Automations** We are empowering users with an in-app logic engine to create custom "IF This, THEN That" rules based on thermostat sensors. *Example:* "IF the acoustic sensor detects a baby crying, THEN send a notification to the parent's phone and adjust the nursery Thermosensor target to 22°C."
