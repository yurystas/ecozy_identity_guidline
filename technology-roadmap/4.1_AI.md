# 4.1 AI

**Text:** Our AI roadmap extends beyond the current Edge AI sound recognition . Future initiatives are focused on two key areas:

1. **Personalized Efficiency:** Developing cloud-based, self-learning algorithms (`heating-algorithm` module) that analyze a user's behavior, local weather forecasts, and room occupancy patterns to create a "set-it-and-forget-it" heating schedule. The goal is to proactively optimize for comfort and energy savings without manual user input.  
2. **Predictive Maintenance:** Utilizing thermostat and central unit telemetry to predict potential hardware failures (e.g., low battery, valve motor degradation) and proactively alert the user to perform maintenance, improving system reliability.
