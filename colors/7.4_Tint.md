In graphic designing the term tint refers to the amount of applied paint – which results in less saturated colors.   
In order to create minimalistic style illustrations, based on our brand's color scheme, you need to go beyond the colors presented on the previous pages. A separate color palette has been prepared specifically to add shades to individual elements on renders. The shades presented here are tints of the primary colors used in brand visual identification. These tints enhance graphics with subtle details that do not distract the target audience from the main content.
