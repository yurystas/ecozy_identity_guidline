# 7.1 Primary Colors

Colors influence human emotions. Well-chosen, can evoke pleasant associations and have a positive impact on the brand image.   
The psychology of colors helped us to choose three main color sets that accurately reflect our brand values.   
**\#FA6705.** Associated with brand, safety and knowledge. Used in the logotype as well as an accent.   
**Burnt amber.** A set of warm and friendly colors, emphasizing commitment and enthusiasm. A great addition in collaterals.   
**Crystal white.** It emphasizes the quality of our products and professional customer service. Perfect for backgrounds.
